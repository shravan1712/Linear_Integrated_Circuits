Aim:
Design and analyse the differential amplifier for the following specifications:
VDD=1.8V, P<=2.2Mv, VICM=0.95V, VOCM=1.1V, VP=0.4V
Perform DC Analysis , Transient Analysis, Frequency response and extract the paramaters.
Differential Amplifier:
Differential amplifiers consist of two transistors M1 and M2, whose sources are joined together. If the two transistors are connected to different voltage inputs, then the current across M1 and M2 are different due to the gate voltage. If the voltage supply at the gate terminal is the same, then the current through M1 and M2 is also the same. This configuration is called "Common-Mode Input Voltage Differential Amplifier". Whatever may be the load resistor, the MOSFET M1 and M2 should not enter the Triode region. It should be verified that the MOSFETs remain in the Saturation Region for proper operation.
 
Procedure : Make the circuit connection as given above. connect the resister at the source terminal of both Mosfet now calculate the value of ISS as power and VDD is given and calculate the ID1 and ID2 now calculate the RSS and RD
To find the all the values of resistor and current value. we need solve the given question specification.
ISS =P/ VDD =2.2/1.8=1.22mA
ID1=ID2 = ISS/2=0.61mA
RD = VDD -VOCM/ID1=1.8-1.1/0.61=1.145kΩ
RSS =Vp/ ISS =0.4/1.22=0.327kΩ
Finally by solving we get
ISS =0.909mA
ID1=ID2=0.61mA
RD =3.55kΩ
RSS =0.327kΩ
Circuit-1

 
Now to get the desired values of output voltage and current we have to vary the width and length of both the Mosfet we got Length=180nm and width=108.5um
 
DC analysis:
To perform the DC analysis we have to select the {DC op pnt} in the edit simulation command and run the simulation the figure below is the values obtained from the DC analysis 
 

Here in dc analysis we got the VOUT as expected and ID1 and ID2 we got the same
Transient analysis:
To perform transient analysis we have to select the transient analysis in the edit simulation and give the stop time as 5ms and run the simulation . and the graph below shows the transient response of the design. 
 
Voltage Gain AV=VOUTP-P /VINP-P
AV=(0.269V/50mV)
AV =5.38
AC analysis:
TO perform AC analysis we have to select the ac analysis in the edit simulation command given the values as shown below ;
 
Gain in db= 20log(AV)
=20log(5.38)
=14.616
Circuit-2:
Now replace the RSS resister with a current source : connect a current source of 1.22mA
 
DC analysis:
To perform the DC analysis we have to select the {DC op pnt} in the edit simulation command and run the simulation the figure below is the values obtained from the DC analysis
 
Trasient analysis:
To perform transient analysis we have to select the transient analysis in the edit simulation and give the stop time as 5ms and run the simulation . and the graph below shows the transient response of the design
we have to give degree of 180deg to one Mosfet and 0deg to the other Mosfet and ac amplitude 1 for one Mosfet and 0 for other Mosfet
 
Voltage Gain AV=VOUTP-P /VINP-P
AV=(1.33-0.870)/(0.999-0.900)
AV =4.64
AC analysis:
 
Gain in db= 20log(AV)
=20log(4.64)
=13.33
Circuit-3: 
DC analysis:
 
Next, we need to calculate power, to make sure that the power is within 2.2 mW, to satisfy our power budget.
P = VDD.ISS = 1.8 V x 1.22226 mA = 2.200068 mW ≈ 2.2 mW
Therefore, this fits our power budget, and we can proceed further. Next, we can perform transient analysis, by applying ac input to any one of the MOSFETs, and then calculating V/V gain, dB gain.

Transient Analysis
Apply a sinusoidal signal with DC offset = VG = 0.95 V, Amplitude = 50 mV, Frequency = 1 kHz. In transient analysis, set stop time to 5 ms. Place the .tran 5m directive anywhere on the schematic and run the simulation.
 
We can calculate the V/V gain by dividing Vout/Vin. Also, the output voltage curve (green) appears inverted compared to the input voltage curve (blue) due to a 180° phase shift.
Av = Vout/Vin = 0.285/50 mV = 5.7 V/V
Converting this to dB, we get A’v = 20log10(Av) = 20log10(5.7) = 15.117 dB
Now, let us perform AC analysis and then verify our calculated results.


AC analysis:
 
As we can see, we get a midband gain of around 15.4 dB, which is close to the calculated value. We can also the 3 dB bandwidth at around 2 GHz. From the figure, we can see that the curve is not the standard frequency response we are used to seeing. This may be due to the effects of the NMOS behaving as a current source, which could explain why a current source is used since it provides stability, and prevents noise and fluctuation.
INFERENCE:
After performing this experiment, we learnt how the differential amplifier operates, and how to build it in LTSpice. We see how the differential amplifier rejects common mode signals, but amplifies differential mode signals, making it the ideal building block for the operational amplifier or the op-amp.
We also observed the three different configurations for the differential amplifier, i.e., with resistance RSS, current source ISS, the NMOS biased as a current source operating in saturation region.
The highest gain we observed was in the NMOS configuration, which provided a dB gain of 15.4 dB, compared to the other two configurations. However, the frequency response for this configuration seems very unstable, with constant fluctuations before the midband (possibly due to the effects of the NMOS).
The advantage of the current source configuration is that we obtained almost exact parameters that we had calculated for. It also provides a more stable current ISS, since there won’t be any fluctuations due to temperature, or any other reason. Lastly the RSS configuration also seems reliable, but with increase in temperature and tolerance errors, we may not get exact value of resistance we calculated, which may decrease or increase our current values, causing issue in power budget.
Overall, the differential amplifier is a very useful configuration, since it measures the difference between the two drain voltages, thereby preventing the effects of any noise. Another point to note is that the differential amplifiers require two exactly matched N-channel MOSFETs, making it easier to implement the circuit in LTSpice, using the 180 nm TSMC .lib technology file.
